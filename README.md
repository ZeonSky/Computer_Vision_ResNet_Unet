# SOTA_CV_ResNet_Unet

I create this repository to review and breakdown SOTA deep learning applications on computer vision that benefit from the advent of ResNet and UNet.

From my experience doing data science and AI work, resonating with the philosophy from Jeremy Howard, founder of fast.ai, I believe in approaching AI subjects from both a top-down and button-up perspective, in that:

Top-down: You start from the end goal in mind, identify use cases of the subject to establish a sense of purpose during the study. 

Button-up: You develop a firm grasp of each building block to acquire ability to accommodate for future use case variations.

Thus, you avoid shifting focus of the craft of AI to necessary but nonessential demonstration of math prowess; and you avoid remaining superficial and inflexible if you limit your attention only to use cases, utilizing useful but high-level packages that hide away what goes on under the hood.

This repository focuses on the top-down perspective. For more button-up approach, please refer to my other repositories:
